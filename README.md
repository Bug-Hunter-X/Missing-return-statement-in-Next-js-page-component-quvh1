# Missing Return Statement in Next.js Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  When a page component doesn't explicitly return JSX, Next.js throws an error. 

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement within its functional component. This results in a runtime error when the `/about` route is accessed. 

## Solution
The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component, ensuring a `return` statement is present to render content.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/about` in your browser. You'll see the error.
5. Now uncomment the solution in `pages/about.js` to see the fix.
